# ElegooCarV3
Software for my ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V3.0

The idea of the project is to have an object-oriented approach to control the car, and to have all features in one implementation.

| Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bluetooth remote controlled | Implementation available |
| Infrared remote controlled | Implementation available |
| Switching driving algorithm via bluetooth remote control | Implementation available |
| Manual mode, without obstacle avoidance | Simple implementation available. Only moves a short distance at a time
| Automatic mode one (Auto-1), continuous driving with obstacle avoidance | Simple implementation available. Has trouble recognizing soft obstacles, smaller obstacles, and walls if approached in angles < 45 degrees or > 135 degrees |
| Automatic mode two (Auto-2), interrupted driving with rescan of environment | Simple implementation available. Has trouble recognizing soft obstacles, smaller obstacles, and walls if approached in angles < 45 degrees or > 135 degrees |
| Line tracking support | Planned |

## IDE

Developing using the Sloeber IDE (for Windows) "Download 64 bits Bundle" from http://eclipse.baeyens.it/stable.php?OS=Windows

## Libraries

Using following libraries:

| Library | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Servo | Comes with the Sloeber IDE |
| IRremote - IRremote-2.2.3.zip | http://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/i-rremote |


## Verify and Upload using the Arduino IDE (section is under construction)

This software can also be used in combination with the regular Arduino IDE, as documented below:

| Step | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| Download and install the Arduino IDE | Download from  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and follow the provided instructions |
| Download and unpack the ElegooCarV3 package | Download https://github.com/pieterbl/ElegooCarV3/blob/master/resources/ElegooCarV3.zip and unpack in your Arduino sketches directory, so that you have a directory ElegooCarV3 with the files ElegooCarV3.ino and the remaining files in it |
| Remove the IRremote Arduino lib | From your path like C:\tools\arduino-1.8.4\libraries, remove the IRremote lib which comes with the Arduino IDE. This library is version 0.1 (you can check the header files), where the ElegooCarV3 project uses version 2.2.3  |
| Download and install the latest IRremote library version | Follow the **Installation** instructions here https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote. Make sure to follow the instructions regarding the RobotIRremote  library  |
| Restart the Arduino IDE and open ElegooCarV3.ino |  Make sure your car is connected with your computer. Press verify to verify the software, and press upload to upload the software to the car |
| Download and configure the bluetooth app | Download the bluetooth  app from the below given locations. Configure the bluetooth app as described below |
| Drive the car  | Have fun and enjoy it |



# Driving the Car

This is how driving the car looks like https://github.com/pieterbl/ElegooCarV3/blob/master/ElegooCarV3.ino

## Driving with Bluetooth

The bluetooth app can be found at the below listed locations:

| Provider | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| Google, Andriod | https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.femtoapp.rootsence.bleutils |
| Apple, iPhone | https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/elegoo-ble-tool/id1195318538 |

The bluetooth app must be configured in the following way:

| Left Column | Middle Column | Right Column |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Half Left (\\)  | Forward (F) | Half Right (/) |
| Left (L)  | Stop (S) | Right (R) |
| Manual (M) | Backward (B) | _empty_ |
| Auto-1 (1)  | Auto-2 (2)  | _empty_  |



# Trouble Shooting

## avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

Lots of articles on this in the Internet. For me, it means the bluetooth receiver must be removed from the car. It is preventing the upload of a new program version to the Arduino.

```

avrdude done.  Thank you.
